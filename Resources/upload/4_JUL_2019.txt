Happy Independence Day!

Today I focused on setting up an environment to run servlets on my private laptop.

I originally was going to setup without an IDE but after working on that I found 
	an eclipse compatible version, below are the links in (I believe) correct
	order for self-installation for anyone who wants to get this primitive up.

SETUP ON WORK LAPTOP NOT TESTED YET! 
	- Since I was originally working with system environment variables this was
		entirely set up on my personal machine, I do not know what will and
		won't work on our work laptops yet, plan to setup tomorrow and update 
		this guide accordingly or drop this approach alltogether.
