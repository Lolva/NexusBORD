What we have done:
	AS OF 2 JUL 2019
		- Local java program w/ file browser support
			- This uses a non-native file browser
			- Found concerns regarding portability
			- Doesn't address potential concerns with front/back end development
			
		- Discovered two prominent technologies for file uploading
			- Selenium and Servlet
				- Potential solution to front/back connection
				- May cause issues with other teams (restricting tools)
				- (Servlet) Shows promise for low front-end presence
					- Currently favoring Servlet/web-app
				- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/servlets/servlets-file-uploading.htm
		
		- Looked into file handling for SQL database
			- BFILE type (aka FILESTREAM) may be an option 
				- https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/appdev.112/e18294/adlob_bfile_ops.htm#ADLOB012
				- There is mention of possible performance hits with this route,
					more research into it being a good fit for us is necessary
