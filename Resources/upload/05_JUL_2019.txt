Progress Report:
	- No progress on testing environment setup on work laptop yet
		- Javascript/CSS work took more time than I originally planned
		
	- On private machine file upload now works
		- User can use a native file browser to select a file
			and have it uploaded to the Java server that then saves it
		- Using a Java backend server running through eclipse
		- Front-end file upload works natively with eclipse AS WELL AS:
			- Firefox
			- Chrome
			- IE
			
		Note: This code was simply pulled from examples and 
			is NOT our own work, once we prove it works on our
			work machines we can start making it our own.

Goal for 07 JUL 2019
	- Setup and test code on work laptops
