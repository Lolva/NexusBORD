What is TDD, Why?
	- A series of small development cycles built around initially creating a test case
		with a desired outcome, then to produce the minimum amount of code to satisfy
		the test case ... rinse repeat
	- General Structure is as such:
		- Add a test (Current goal to satisfy)
		- Run all tests and check if new one fails (Generally will)
		- Write some code (To satisfy the new test)
		- Run tests (Run all tests again, confirm new issues didn't form)
		- Refactor code (Incorporate changes into main code)
		- Repeat (Continue process for entirety of development)
	- Process has a strong prevention towards developer burnout
		- Micro goals to achieve with very specific requirements
	- Works extremely well (and even at it's best) when all requirements	
		of project are still not known
		- Provides incremental approach towards ambiguous designs
		- The tests help give form to the project as opposed to 
			rigid documentation
